<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
<br />

✏️ After 4 years of experience in self taught game development I'm preparing my Bachelor of Application Developer and Designer via an apprenticeship. (full stack developer capabilities) Note: I'm French and I'm based near Paris.

👨‍💻 Game Development offered me different skill sets: Programming (Object Oriented), Team / Project Management, Networking (multiplayer), Internationalization, [...]

⚙️ I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and my professional goal is to sign an apprenticeship contract in order to work in the company on a long term basis.

❤️ I have an unconditional love for the development sphere but code isn't everything to me: The user is also my priority and so is choosing the right tool for the right task.
