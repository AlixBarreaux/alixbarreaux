<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
<br />

✏️ After 6 years of experience in self taught game development and 1,5 years as a test automation engineer I'm open to any type of opportunity in these domains.

🌎 I can move anywhere in the world provided you have an interesting offer!

👨‍💻 Game Development offered me different skill sets: Programming (Object Oriented), Team Projects Management, Networking (multiplayer), Internationalization, [...]

⚙️ I'm working with Playwright, Cypress, React, HTML, CSS, TypeScript / JavaScript.

❤️ I have an unconditional love for the development sphere but code isn't everything to me: The user is also my priority and so is choosing the right tool for the right task.
