<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
<br />

✏️ I'm developing games with Godot Engine since ~2019 with different teams I managed or solo in both 2D and 3D. I'm working on multiplayer projects with dedicated servers with previous Web Development / Automated Testing work experience. I'm passionate about Open Source, Game Design, Testing and Accessibility.

🌎 I'm open to new opportunities anywhere in the world!

👨‍💻 Game / Web Development helped me forge different skill sets: Team / Project Management, DevOps, Networking (multiplayer), Test Automation, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Internationalization, and more.

⚙️ I mainly use Godot Engine, Taiga, Git, Blender, GDUnit4, Podman / Docker.

❤️ I have an unconditional love for game dev but technical work isn't everything to me: The Player is my priority and so is my Team.
